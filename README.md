# Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow and Amazon Redshift

This is a repository contains sample Apache Airflow DAGs that are used in this blog post. The blog will show you how to take source data and import it into Amazon Redshift, and then show you how you can export that same data out to Amazon S3. I have also provided the variables.json file to make it easy for you to setup the needed Apache Airflow variables that the DAGS will use.

This is a more detailed version of the launch blog post, [Introducing Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow-mwaa/), as well as Morrie Swerlick who provided the inspiration for this post.
